Transpose.py contains two functions, transpose and main. The main function gets and reads the file containing a matrix from the command line parameter. For each line of the file text containing the matrix, the main function: splits the line of text in the file by spaces, stores each value from that line of text inside a list (sublist), and adds the sublist of each line of text from the line to a list containing all of the sublists (sublists of each line of text from the matrix file). The main function then calls the transpose function. The transpose function takes one parameter, matrix, which is the list of all of the sublists of each line of text (each row of the original matrix). For the length the substrings of the original matrix, the transpose function takes the place value of each substring in the original matrix (first value of each substring, second value of each substring, third value of each substring, etc.) and adds the values of each substring at this place value to a new sublist. This new sublist is then added/appended to a list, transMatrix, containing all of the sublists for the transposed matrix. The transpose function returns transMatrix to the main function and the main function assigns the transposed matrix to a variable, transMatrix. The main function then creates and opens a new file entered by the user through the command line parameters. For each sublist (row) of transMatrix, the main function: accumulates each value of the sublist to a string (with a tab inbetween each value) and writes the string of the sublist in the new file, with each string of a sublist on its own line. The main function then closes the file that was read and the new file that was written in.
The program should be run as:
python3 tranpose.py matrix2.txt transposedmatrix.txt
*matrix2.txt can be replaced with the name of another matrix file*
*transposedmatrix.txt is the name of the new file being written in. It can be named by the user and does not need to be called tranposedmatrix.txt*
